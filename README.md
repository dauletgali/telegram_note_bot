# üìù Telegram Note Bot

Why do I need another note taking solution when literally dozens of similar apps exists? Answer is simple, it takes time to adopt new app on my iPhone. Honestly, all users use only 5-6 apps on their phone. Since I use telegram as my main messaging app, I would like to have my personal bot to whom I can trust my thoughts. Also, what I don't like in all note taking apps is that I can see my notes (paradoxically) all the time. I like clean chat so i do not distract with my old notes. Thus, I needed a solution such that at any time of day I can open my primary messaging app and send note which will be saved in the simplest form to the google sheets. When I need (probably at the beginnging of day), I can open my google sheet and look through important information. 

A personal Telegram bot that saves your messages as notes in Google Sheets and sends you one random note per day at a random time between 10:00 and 22:00.

```bash
python claude_bot.py
```

The bot will:
- Save messages you send
- Delete them after a short delay

## üì¶ Optional: Docker

Added dockerfile from which I built my image. Important thing to consider: bot rely on timezone information, and you need to run image with your timezone

```bash
docker run -e "TZ=YourTimeZone" your-image-name
```
Example in my case 

```bash
docker run -e "TZ=Asia/Almaty" telegram-note-bot
```

## üì¶ To-DO

1. Add a local AI (probably LLAMA) which will read note and categorize it to the some groups: "useful quote", "gym", "remember to do", "other". Then bot should send information only from "useful quote" category.
2. Add function ‚Äò
3. Add feature to talk with AI when message starts with "qq". i.e. When you enter grocery store you type "qq i am at grocery what I need to buy?" then AI will go through your notes and reply and disappeare after sometime.
